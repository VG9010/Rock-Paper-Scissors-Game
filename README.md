Rock Paper Scissors Game created by using a HTML,CSS,JavaScript

"Rock, Paper, Scissors" is a classic hand game played between two people. The game has simple rules: each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. The possible shapes are rock (a fist), paper (an open hand), and scissors (a fist with the index and middle fingers extended, forming a V).

The outcome of the game is determined by the chosen shapes:

Rock crushes scissors (rock wins)
Scissors cuts paper (scissors win)
Paper covers rock (paper wins)
If both players choose the same shape, the game is a tie and typically played again.
